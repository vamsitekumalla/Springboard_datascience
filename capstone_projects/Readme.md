### Price prediction of Airbnb property in San Francisco 

**Problem Statement**:
 Predicting the nightly rate of Airbnb property in San Francisco, CA

				
**Problem Description**

Several Airbnb properties are available for rent in San Francisco area with different price range and amenities. 
			
One challenge that Airbnb hosts face is determining the optimal nightly rent price. In many areas, guests are presented with a good selection of listings and can filter on criteria like price, number of bedrooms, room type, and more. The amount a host can charge on a nightly basis is closely linked to the dynamics of the marketplace. 

With the available data, this project is attempting to find correlations between the attributes like location, type of accommodation, number of beds etc., and price of the property. This Project examines and analyzes the data using the tools available in Python to explore the following:	
1.	Demographics of Airbnb listings
 						
2.	Exploratory analysis of property listings with the available features
 						
3.	With the above analyses, predicting the cost of a new Airbnb property in the area
 							 					
Combining all of the above, it is attempted to build a reliable model which can predict the nightly rate of an existing or a new Airbnb property in the area using Machine Learning algorithms	
		

**Data**

Most of the Data is acquired from [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html) website for San Francisco.<br/>

Several datasets which are available for a given city, as listed, are used :<br/>
•	Listings<br/>
•	Calendar<br/>
•	Reviews<br/>
•	Neighborhoods<br/>
